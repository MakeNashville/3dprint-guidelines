# 3D Print Shop Guidelines

Welcome to the 3D Print Shop! Whether this is your first print or your hundredth, these guidelines help keep printers running, prints succeeding, and the shop a great place for everyone.

### By using the space, you agree to:

* Follow the community & personal filament guidelines below.
* Share the printers fairly:
    * **If you're in the lab:** Use a maximum of 2 printers at a time. Broken printers count as "in use."
    * **If you're leaving the lab:** Limit yourself to 1 printer running.
* Accept that others may move your completed prints.
* Be kind and curious about things, situations, and others.
* Leave the space cleaner than you found it.
* Report broken printers in Slack at #3dprint.
* Follow general Make Nashville policies.


## Live Orientations

Orientations are held biweekly, are open to all skill levels, and require pre-registration on Eventbrite. They fill up fast, so grab a spot early! Register by searching "Make Nashville" on Eventbrite or scanning the QR code.

Attending an orientation is not required to print, but it's encouraged. If you don't follow the shop's rules and guidelines, you may need to retake an orientation before printing again.


## How to Print (Quick Start)

New to 3D printing? Don't worry, the basic workflow is simpler than it looks:

1. **Open OrcaSlicer** on the shop computer.
2. **Pick an available printer** from the printer dropdown.
3. **Load your file** (STL, OBJ, or 3MF) via SD card, AirDrop, email, or USB.
4. **Slice it!** Hit the Slice button and review the preview.
5. **Send it to print.** Click "Print Plate". For Bambu Lab printers, select the correct printer (fruit name) a second time.
6. **Watch the first layer** go down. This is the most important part of the print. Stick around for the first few minutes.
7. **Claim your printer.** Write your name on a whiteboard tag and place it in front of the printer.
8. **When it's done,** clean the build plate, return the whiteboard tag to the crate, and grab your print!

## Using OrcaSlicer

* In OrcaSlicer, make sure you select the correct:
    * Printer profile
    * Filament type
    * Process (print quality)

> ❌ Do not change default printer settings or printer profiles.

* After clicking "Print Plate" on Bambu Lab printers, name your print with your **Slack display name + project name**, separated by a dash.
    * Example: `kevinahuber-pumpkin`
    * **Tip:** Join the #3dprint-info channel in Slack to monitor your print remotely.


## Printer Setup

Before each print:
* **Clean the build plate:** Give the plate a single spray of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and wipe it down with a microfiber cloth. This removes oils and helps the first layer stick.
* **Label your printer:** Place a whiteboard tag with your Slack display name in front of your printer.

> ❌ Do not use the microfiber cloths to clean whiteboards.

* **Keep the door closed** while the printer is running.
* **If something breaks:** Try to fix it, or place a cone in front of the printer with a whiteboard label explaining the issue and post the status in #3dprint on Slack.

## Filament

### Community Filament

* **Under 100g/month:** Free! Print away, no worries.
* **Over 100g/month:** Please bring your own filament or replace what you use with an equal or greater amount.
* **Want to donate?** Have leftover filament or want to share something fun? Write "community" clearly on the spool and add it to the rack.
* Community filament on the rack works with all printers unless labeled otherwise (AMS restrictions still apply).

### Personal Filament

* You're welcome to store personal filament at the shop for active projects.
* **Label your spool** with your name and the date you brought it in. Make the label visible, and re-label if needed.
* Filament left for 3+ months without contact will be converted to community filament. Store personal spools on the shelves in the closet.

### Loading & Unloading Filament

#### All Printers
* **Check for tangles first.** Unwind and fix any knots, kinks, or tangles before loading.
* **Always verify whose filament it is.** Never print with someone else's filament without their permission.
* **Put filament back where it belongs** when you're done: community rack or personal shelves.
    * **Tip:** Run cleaning filament (in the bins below the machines) before and after using filaments that leave residue.

#### Bambu Lab without AMS (Kiwi, Strawberry, Papaya)
* Use the **Feeding** menu on the printer's touchscreen to run the unload/load process.

#### Bambu Lab with AMS (Mango, Huckleberry)

> ❌ Do **not** use TPU, PVA, or other flexible filaments with the AMS.

* **To load:** Push the gray tab forward and insert your filament. The AMS will pull it in automatically.
    * Do **not** use the Load/Unload option in the "Feeding" menu for AMS printers.
* **Cardboard spools** must have printed adapter rims installed before loading into the AMS.

#### Prusa XL
* Go to the **Filament** menu on the printer and select Load, Unload, or Change Filament. Select the filament type that matches what you're removing or loading.

### Types of Filament

Not sure which filament to use? Here's a quick cheat sheet:

| Filament | Works With | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **PLA** | All printers | Easiest to print. Great for most projects. |
| **PETG** | All printers | Stronger and more heat-resistant than PLA. A bit stringy. |
| **TPU** | Kiwi, Strawberry, Papaya only | Flexible/rubbery. Needs a direct-drive extruder (no AMS). |
| **ABS / ASA** | Enclosed printers only | Strong and heat-resistant, but requires ventilation. |
| **Anything else** | Ask first! | Post in #3dprint before printing exotic materials. |

## Common Troubleshooting

### Wet Filament

Filament absorbs moisture from the air over time, and Nashville humidity doesn't help. Wet filament leads to bad prints.

**How to tell:** You hear popping or crackling during printing, see excessive stringing, the surface looks rough or bubbly, or the filament snaps easily when you bend it.

**What to do:**
- Keep filament stored below 30% relative humidity. TPU and Nylon prefer under 20%.
- Dry filament before long or structural prints, especially PETG and TPU.
- **To dry:** Place the spool in a polydryer container with the filament feeding out through the side hole, set it on top of the dryer, and run it for 4-8 hours. Replace the bottom hole caps when done.

### Clogged Nozzle / Hot End

**How to tell:** Extrusion slows down, stops completely, skips, or you hear clicking from the extruder motor.

**What to do:**
1. **Stop the print** immediately.
2. **Run the unload filament process** from the printer menu.
3. **Inspect the nozzle.** Remove the hot end and pull out any visible obstructions.
4. **Try a cold pull.** This is a technique where you heat the nozzle, push filament through, let it cool, then pull the filament out, bringing debris with it.
5. **Use the nozzle needle** only while the nozzle is hot. Never force it when cold.
6. **Still clogged?** Swap the nozzle entirely. It's often faster than fighting a stubborn clog.
