# 3D Print Shop Guidelines

### By using the space, you agree to:

* Abide by posted community & personal filament guidelines.
* Not hog printers: If you use more than one printer at a time, leave at least one printer of each model available for use. (i.e., if 1 Bambu Lab is in use and 3 are available, use only 2). 
* Accept that others may move your completed prints.
* Be kind and curious about things, situations, and others. 
* Leave the space cleaner than found
* Report any broken printers to Slack in #3dprint
* Abide by general Make Nashville policies.



## Live Orientations

Orientations are held biweekly, are open to all skill levels, and require pre-registration on Eventbrite. Currently orientations fill up quickly, we recommend snagging a spot quickly. Register on Eventbrite by searching or scanning the QR code. 
Attending an orientation is not required to print but encouraged. If you do not abide by the rules and guidelines of the shop, you may be required to retake orientation before using the shop again. 


## To print

1. Open OrcaSlicer on the shop computer.
2. Choose an available printer from the printer dropdown.
3. Load your STL, obj, or 3mf file (you may need to use the SD cards, drive, airdrop, or email to load a custom file)
4. Slice!
5. Choose “Print Plate”. If using a Bambu Lab printer, choose the correct fruit name a second time. 
    1. Note: If a Sovol print is not sending, open Octoprint in the browser with the respective printers bookmark and click reconnect.
6. Watch the first layer of your print start.
7. Write your name on a whiteboard plate and place it in front of the printer. 
8. When complete, clean your plate and return the whiteboard to the crate when complete.



## Community Computer

* Password for the computer is ***
* Use Orca Slicer, choose the correct: 
    * Printer profile
    * Filament type

❌  Do not change default printer settings or printer profiles.

* After clicking “Print Plate”, (on Bambu Lab printers),  name your print with your slack display name + “-” + project name. 
    * i.e: kevinahuber-pumpkin
    * Protip: Go to the #3dprint-info channel to monitor your print.


## Printer Setup

* Spray each plate with a single spray of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and wipe with a microfiber cloth before printing. 
* Place a whiteboard with your slack display name in front of your print.

❌ Do not use the microfiber cloths to clean whiteboards.

* Do not open the printer door while the printer is operating.
* If a printer breaks, you may try to repair it or place a cone in front of it with a whiteboard label and post in slack with the printer’s status.

## Filament

### Community Filament

* Usage under 100g/month: Free! No need to worry.
* Usage over 100g/month: Please bring your own filament or replace what you use with an equal or greater amount.
* Have leftover filament? Want to see how others use a unique new filament? Just feeling generous? Donate to community filament! 
    * Write “community” clearly on the roll and add it to the rack. 
* Filament on the rack is compatible with all devices unless labeled otherwise.



### Personal Filament

* Store personal filament here for you to use for active personal projects and parts. 
* Write your name & the date brought in. 
* Make sure to make it visible- repeat if needed. 
* If you leave filament here and we cannot get ahold of you 3 months after storage date, we’ll convert it to community filament. Store it on the shelves in the closet/

### Unloading/Loading

* Bambu Lab: Run unload/load process under the “feeding” menu on each machine to swap filament. 
* Sovols:
* Prusa XL: 
* Unwind and fix knots, kinks, and tangles before loading. 
* ALWAYS check which filament you are printing with; never print with someone else’s filament without permission. 
* Return unloaded filament to the correct community rack or on one of the personal filament shelfs. 
    * Protip: Run cleaning filament (in bins below machines) before and after using filaments with residue.



### Types of filament

## Fundraising for Prusa XL Upgrades


We are hoping to beef up our PrusaXL to five heads. This will allow us to specialize heads– TPU, smaller/larger sizes, etc. This will also allow us to print with five (!) colors/materials with little to no change cost. 

Here’s the upgrade: Dual Head to Five Head Upgrade 

To donate, send money with the memo “PrusaXL” to @MakeNashville on Venmo or a check/cash to staff (@user or @user). 

We are a 501c(3) organization, ask for a receipt if you’d like!
