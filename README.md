# 3D Print Shop Guidelines
These guidelines exist to keep printers running, parts successful, and the shop welcoming for everyone. 

### By using the space, you agree to:

* Abide by posted community & personal filament guidelines.
* Not hog printers: If you use more than one printer at a time, leave at least one printer of each model available for use. (i.e., if 1 Bambu Lab is in use and 3 are available, use only 2). 
* Accept that others may move your completed prints.
* Be kind and curious about things, situations, and others. 
* Leave the space cleaner than found
* Report any broken printers to Slack in #3dprint
* Abide by general Make Nashville policies.



## Live Orientations

Orientations are held biweekly, are open to all skill levels, and require pre-registration on Eventbrite. Currently orientations fill up quickly, we recommend snagging a spot quickly. Register on Eventbrite by searching or scanning the QR code. 
Attending an orientation is not required to print but encouraged. If you do not abide by the rules and guidelines of the shop, you may be required to retake orientation before using the shop again. 


## To print

1. Open OrcaSlicer on the shop computer.
2. Choose an available printer from the printer dropdown.
3. Load your STL, OBJ, or 3MF file (via SD card, AirDrop, email, or USB).
4. Slice!
5. Choose “Print Plate”. If using a Bambu Lab printer, choose the correct fruit name a second time. 
6. Watch the first layer of your print start.
7. Write your name on a whiteboard plate and place it in front of the printer. 
8. When complete, clean your plate and return the whiteboard to the crate when complete.



## Community Computer

* Password for the computer is ***
* Use Orca Slicer, choose the correct: 
    * Printer profile
    * Filament type
    * Process

❌  Do not change default printer settings or printer profiles.

* After clicking “Print Plate”, (on Bambu Lab printers),  name your print with your Slack display name + “-” + project name. 
    * i.e: kevinahuber-pumpkin
    * Protip: Go to the #3dprint-info channel to monitor your print.


## Printer Setup

* Spray each plate with a single spray of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and wipe with a microfiber cloth before printing. 
* Place a whiteboard with your Slack display name in front of your print.

❌ Do not use the microfiber cloths to clean whiteboards.

* Do not open the printer door while the printer is operating.
* If a printer breaks, you may try to repair it or place a cone in front of it with a whiteboard label and post in slack with the printer’s status.



## Filament

### Community Filament

* Usage under 100g/month: Free! No need to worry.
* Usage over 100g/month: Please bring your own filament or replace what you use with an equal or greater amount.
* Have leftover filament? Want to see how others use a unique new filament? Just feeling generous? Donate to community filament! 
    * Write “community” clearly on the roll and add it to the rack. 
* Filament on the rack is compatible with all devices unless labeled otherwise (AMS restrictions still apply).



### Personal Filament

* Store personal filament here for you to use for active personal projects and parts. 
* Write your name & the date brought in. 
* Make sure to make it visible- repeat if needed. 
* If you leave filament here and we cannot get ahold of you 3 months after storage date, we’ll convert it to community filament. Store it on the shelves in the closet.

### Unloading/Loading

#### All Printers
* Unwind and fix knots, kinks, and tangles before loading. 
* ALWAYS check which filament you are printing with; never print with someone else’s filament without permission. 
* Return unloaded filament to the correct community rack or on one of the personal filament shelves. 
    * Protip: Run cleaning filament (in bins below machines) before and after using filaments with residue.

#### Bambu Lab without AMS (Kiwi, Strawberry, Papaya)
* Run unload/load process under the “feeding” menu on each machine to swap filament.

#### Bambu Lab with Automatic Material System (Mango, Huckleberry)
❌ Do not use TPU, PVA, or other flexible filaments with AMS
* Load filament by pushing the gray tab forward and inserting your filament in. 
    * Do not run the Load/Unload process from the “Feeding” menu
* Cardboard spools MUST have printed rims installed before loading into the AMS.

#### Prusa XL
* Run Load, Unload, or Change filament under the "Filament" menu. Select the filament type of the filament you will be removing. 

### Types of filament

* PLA & PETG → All printers
* TPU → Direct drive required (Kiwi, Strawberry, Papaya) 
* ABS & ASA → Enclosures required
* Everything else → ask in #3dprint

## Common Troubleshooting
### Wet Filament
Indicators: You hear popping, see stringing, the surface looks rough, or the filament breaks easily when bending.
- Keep filament below 30% RH (TPU & Nylon prefer under 20%).
- Dry before long or structural prints, especially PETG or TPU.
- Place a filament in a polydryer container, with filament sticking out the side filament hole, on top of the dryer. Remove after 4-8 hours and replace bottom hole caps. 

### Clogged Hot End
Indicators: Extrusion slows, stops, skips, or clicks
1. Stop the print immediately
2. Run the unload filament process.
3. Remove the hot end and pull any obvious obstructions.
4. Run a cold pull 
5. Use the nozzle needle only while hot– never force it cold.
6. If it still won’t flow, swap the nozzle (it’s often faster than fighting it).
